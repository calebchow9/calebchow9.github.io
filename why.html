<p>This is going to be by far the most important post to me. There's just so much to say, so many thoughts to let out, so many experiences to share...so here is a jumble of ideas, convictions, and laments consolidated into one post. Before you read on, the <strong>most important thing</strong> I want to stress from this is that I simply want to share to y'all about how much Christianity and being Christian has affected my life. I can't and don't want to pressure you to believe anything. If anything I say relates to your life, and you feel intrigued to think more about this stuff, then definitely go ahead. Seek answers, because I promise you it'll be worth it. But if not, that's totally fine too. Enjoy this read while you go take a dump or something.</p>

<p>Let's leave out the 'hot topics' out of this post - stuff like evolution, homosexuality, dating, hell, afterlife. No, I'm not shying away from talking about these things, but for now I'm going to focus on my personal experience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some things important to note - yes, I was born into a Christian family. I grew up from womb to present going to a Cantonese-speaking church. Sunday mornings always meant waking up "early" to go to church service. So yes, it's definitely fair to say I <strong>might </strong>be biased in the sense that I've never known what it's like to not be surrounded by Christians.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>But</strong> before you stop reading this, I'm letting you know it <strong>has not</strong> been a smooth ride at all. And it's definitely not meant to be. I've gone through phases where I thought Christianity was stupid, a bunch of fake people who made up something in a weak attempt to explain things they weren't smart enough to understand. One of the big things I always questioned was why do I need God if I can just put in X amount of work and get the results I want? Why do I need God if I'm happy right now? Why should I believe in a God if bad things continue to happen? These questions, which are the reason why I've doubted Christianity so many times, are the <strong>exact </strong>reason why I can confidently say that I am a Christian and believe in God. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>It's through all these doubts and my desire to find an answer to these questions that I've realized that the answers for all these questions are found in Christianity, in the Bible. And through this, I am able to make sense of reality.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2><b>I am a Christian because I believe everything the Bible says is the truth.</b></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sounds crazy, unbelievable, naive? Yeah, that's what I thought too. But let me show you how I was able to reconcile and wrap my head around how Christianity answers these questions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Growing up in an Asian household and going to a relatively competitive high school, I always had the idea of <strong>success </strong>ingrained in my head. All around me were people striving to be the best - study the hardest, so they could get into the best college possible, and eventually land the job with the best pay possible. Being the competitive person I am, I quickly absorbed myself into the mindset. Senior year of high school, I sat my butt down and studied hard. I'm not proud of it, but along the way I used some shortcuts to get through - I cheated a bit, schemed along the way. In the end, the combination of hard work and dishonesty got me where I had pictured myself. I was satisfied with my academic success.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Or so I thought. College application season went by, and I didn't get into the college I wanted to get into. I was bummed, to say the very least. <em>If I had just worked a little hard, I could have got in. If I had just added one more thing to my application, surely that would have wowed them enough to let me in.</em> I'm sure that feeling is universal. The "I was so close", the emotion that makes you clench your fist and grit your teeth. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Spoiler alert</strong>: nothing done through your own strength can ever be 100% certain. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I'll never know how much more I could have done in order to get me into the college I wanted to. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Alright, that's cool, but that's life. I should strive to be the best I can so that I can succeed and make a ton of money to provide for a family. Maybe I'll even toss a couple bucks at a charity or something. </em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That's what I thought too, but as I kept thinking about it, I realized it was all just a never ending cycle. You make more and more money, and then what? When are you ever going to be <strong>satisfied</strong>? Sure, you can say "I'll be satisfied when I have enough money to provide for a family and myself", but can you ever quantify that? There's always a "better" way, always more you can do. Your whole life would be summed up in a sentence: you work, work harder, and then work even harder, and then you die. Are you happy?</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>"So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God."</p><cite>1 Corinthians 10:31 (NIV)</cite></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here's what the Bible says about success: whatever you do, do it to glorify God. Live for God.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yeah. That's it. It's that simple, yet has so many implications. It's an entirely different mindset that is the complete opposite of what almost everything in the world says. Today's consumerist and individualistic society tells you to work hard so that YOU can live comfortably. The Bible calls for something <strong>SO </strong>much simpler than that. Live for God, and everything else will fall into place. It's <strong>not</strong> saying you can't work hard, it's <strong>not </strong>saying to go slack off, but it's saying to focus on the intentions of your actions. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Okay, but so what? How does living for God give you a sense of satisfaction?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><b>Pure, inexplicable joy.</b></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bible says when you love God and live for him you'll be overwhelmed with an inexplicable joy. And this joy has such a bigger meaning than just happiness. It's rooted in satisfaction, in contentment. The Bible doesn't promise you a big house and a nice car. It doesn't say life will come easy to you. Sure, it could happen, and if it does, then use those things to give glory to God. But what it <strong>100% promises you</strong> is a joy that can't be taken away when you love God and live for Him. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that meant so much for me. Realigning my priorities and changing my focus has truly given me more perspective and made me a joyful person. I can write out everything and share my experience, but it's just one of those things where you have to take that leap of faith and believe to fully experience it. I'm not saying I'm magically this 24/7 happy person now, and I am still definitely a prideful person at times, but every time I fall into a pit of frustration or sadness, I'm able to point myself back to this perspective. And find joy again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is just one of the answers to my questions I've found and experienced through searching the Bible for answers. There's so much more to talk about, so many more blessings I've gotten from seeking answers and so much to be thankful for.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am a Christian because I realize that I am not a 'good' person. Being Christian doesn't demand perfection, promise success, or guarantee a comfortable life. It does, however, require you to cast aside your pride and fill yourself with a humble and loving heart.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All glory be to God.</p>
