      <p>I am a STEM oriented guy. I'm not good at writing. I could care less about grammar. One of my proudest accomplishments heading into college was not having to take another English course for the rest of my life. I respect a good piece of writing that makes you <strong>feel</strong>, sure, but I just don't have the eloquence that those English majors have. But here we are...</p>

      <p>I've been told a lot over the years that I'm a pretty reserved person. I like to keep things in my head. I don't seem to share much about myself, yet I'm always listening. And because of this, I'm not a great person to relate to. I get it - it's hard to be vulnerable with someone who seems to have this <strong>facade </strong>of a 'carefree' and 'chill' personality. To all these people in my life, you're absolutely not wrong. On the surface, I guess it can seem off-putting or harsh to some people. Am I trying to seem superior or more mature than other people? Do I care about my friends or do I just keep everyone at a certain arm's length from me? Am I really chilling? </p>

      <p>My answer to all those questions and more is <strong>yes</strong>. Yes, I get caught up with the satisfaction and self-pride of feeling like I know more than people. Yes, I care about all my friends, but yes, I am a selfish person. A lazy person. And for those who understand my lingo, yes, I am always chilling.</p>

      <p>So here is my attempt at getting things out of my head. Thoughts, complaints, praises, anything. If there's one thing I've learned to appreciate, it's <strong>honesty</strong>. I love when you feel the raw truth coming from something said. I'll most definitely be wrong about things, too critical about things, too strong about things. But through all things I hope to be true to what I believe. </p>
