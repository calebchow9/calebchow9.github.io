  <!-- <p> one of my first intervarsity events and my first retreat of college, we woke up to see the sunrise on the lake after staying up to see the moon over
    the lake the previous night. sunrises at retreats seems like a common tradition among all churches, so it felt nostalgic but new at the same time.
    can't say it was worth the no sleep, but golden hour was nice i guess...

      out of desperation we began to slowly walk back, knowing that it would be impossible to walk back by dark. along the way,
